Ok so here my research starts, god saves the queen.

My goal is to find an abstract way to define a geoscience simulation modelling problem,
where all implementations details are abstracted.

Therefore, I need to make a review on what kinds of problems geoscientists handle and how they describe them.

\subsection{Reservoir Exploitation}
Reservoir exploitation includes for example carbon sequestration or oil production.

Defining a reservoir simulation problem is all about listing fluid and reservoirs properties, 
including their relationship to pressure, temperature and composition. \cite{reservoir-review}
